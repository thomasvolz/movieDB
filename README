About:

This is an attempt to learn a bit about web development and the utilization of restful API's
using The MovieDB's restful service.

This task was given to me originally upon a job application and I thought it would be a great opportunity
to learn more about using Angular and restful API services.


Development:

Production of this product was done using the Eclipse IDE and the Angular support set for it.
It includes a basic index.html page that calls to a javascript backend.
