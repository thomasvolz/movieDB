About:

This is an attempt to learn a bit about web development and the utilization of restful API's
using The MovieDB's restful service.

This task was given to me originally upon a job application and I thought it would be a great opportunity
to learn more about using Angular and restful API services.


Development:

Production of this product was done using the Eclipse IDE and the Angular support set for it.
It includes a basic index.html page that calls to a javascript backend.

I am using Bootstrap for the CSS design of the page, hopefully everything looks good.

The logic is written by me.  It did take a bit of time, I'm not the sharpest tool or the quickest
student but I do learn.

This product is best viewed on Google Chrome, I tested it in Chrome and Firefox, for some reason images weren't
loading in Firefox even though I was not disabling them.  On Chrome it worked fine.
