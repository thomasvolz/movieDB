About:
******

This is an attempt to learn a bit about web development and the utilization of restful API's
using The MovieDB's restful service.

This task was given to me originally upon a job application and I thought it would be a great opportunity
to learn more about using Angular and restful API services.


************
Development:
************

Production of this product was done using the Eclipse IDE, Apache Tomcat Sever 8.5,
and the Angular support set for it.  It includes a basic index.html page that calls 
to a javascript backend.

I am using Bootstrap for the CSS design of the page, hopefully everything looks good.

The logic is written by me.  It did take a bit of time, I'm not the sharpest tool or the quickest
student but I do learn.

This product is best viewed on Google Chrome, I tested it in Chrome and Firefox, for some reason 
images weren't loading in Firefox even though I was not disabling them.  On Chrome it worked fine.

Important Files:
****************

WebContent/
-----------index.html /*The main functioning page for the query*/
-----------css/
---------------main.css /*CSS Style sheet */
-----------img/ /*All included images, such as The MovieDB logo */
-----------js/
--------------app.js /*instantiation of the main control app */
--------------controllers/
--------------------------MainController.js /*The main control function for the restful query */


*********************
Building and Running:
*********************

The file structure is needed for this as this is an Angular project built in Eclipse.  This must be either 
deployed or run on a simulated server environment such as Apache Tomcat.

Access index.html, enter your search query into the field and view your returned results.

*************
Known Issues:
*************

Formatting:  I have tried to get the returned results to align in a column style and be even,
but they are being offset and several results appear in an uneven format.  I believe this is in the
column spacing for the ng-repeat command and will look into cleaning this up.

Multiple pages of results: At this time I am showing only one page of results.  In some cases
this is fine, a query of 'Deadpool' returns 7 results on 1 page, but a query of 'Titanic' returns
98 results over 5 pages.  I will either need to ensure all results populate on one page or
produce multiple pages for large returns such as this.

*******************
Future Development:
*******************

I would like to display a little bit more information on the movies if I can.  The MovieDB api's 'get'
does not include 'Budget' or 'Box Office'.  Personally, I like to see this information when I'm looking
at a movie and get annoyed when I have to go digging for it.  For example, look up a movie on Metacritic
or Rotten Tomatoes and you get such small info on it.  Their rating is prominent, then user ratings, then
not much else.  

The box office and budget to me is the most important aggregate of how good a movie was.  Well, except
when it's an Adam Sandler film.

I'd also like to add 'starring' and 'directed' to the return, but these aren't in the 'get' query.  These
are likely available through other restful methods and so are in line for my next stages in developing this.

I believe I will continue to work on this, it's good to learn how to do new things and this gives me
an excuse to do just that.
